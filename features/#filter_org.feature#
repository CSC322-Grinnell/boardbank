Feature: Filter org

   As a BoardBank Organization
   So I can see which users I am interested in
   I want to be able to filter the list of users

Background:
	Given I login as a User
	And I am on the homepage
	Given the following organizations exist:
	|OName             | About                         | Email     | Password |
	|Happy Makers      | Making people happy           | hm@hm.com | password |
	|Animal Shelter    | Rescuing stray dogs           | as@as.com | password |
	|L0vely            | Nerd dating app	           | L0@ve.com | password |
	|Mary's Cupcakes   | Free cookies for all children | mc@mc.com | password |

Scenario: Filter List of 
	  When I follow "Users"
	  Then I should be on the Users page
	  And I should see "List of Users"
	  When I check the "Early Childhood" Box
	  And I press the "Filter" button
	  Then I should see "enuj@lemon.com"
	  And I should not see "l0vely@nerd.com"
